            Discord gives you the power to create an invite-only home for your friends or community - a place where you can talk, hang out, and have fun. We call these special places - servers.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can join or create servers for all kinds of communities - be it a book club, a dance class, a study group, or just some friends you want to spend time with.

          <p>Your server is made up of text channels and voice channels.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
             Text Channels
            </li>
            <p>Text channels are separate spaces for talking over text. They keep conversations organized and give everyone plenty of room to talk. Create separate channels for all the topics your group likes to talk about--from fishing trips to cooking tips.</p>
            <li>Voice Channels</li>
            <p>Voice channels are where you can hang out over voice and video. There’s no calling or ringing required - just click on a voice channel to enter it. Friends in your server can see you’re in there, and pop in to talk, wave hello over video, or share their screen. </p>

            Every Discord server has a library of emojis, and you can turn any image into a custom emoji for your server’s library. You know that cute little tongue blep your dog makes? Yeah, that could be an emoji, too!</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Step 1: Make sure you have the Manage Emoji permission</li>
            <p>If you’re the server creator, you have this automatically. If not, you can ask your server’s owner to grant it to you.</p>
            <li>Step 2: Head to your Server Settings</li>
            <p>On Desktop, click on your server name to open the dropdown menu, and select Server Settings.</p>
            <p>On Mobile, swipe left to your channel view, and tap your server name and select Server Settings.</p>
            <li>Step 3: Go to the Emoji tab and Upload!</li>
            <p>From Server Settings, select the Emoji tab and from there you can upload custom emoji that anyone on the server can use!</p>
            <code
            >Pro Tip: If you’re a Discord Nitro subscriber, you can also upload gifs to use as animated emoji.
